# RFID_customer_behavior

**Dataset description**

In our study, we investigated the shopping behavior of customers within a retail store, specifically examining their actions while browsing products. To initiate this study, we introduced an RFID-enabled shelf within the retail establishment. This shelf consists of a singular RFID reader and an antenna oriented directly towards the products, where passive tags were attached. Following this, we collected the receive signal strength (RSS) emitted by the tags across various customer behavior scenarios. We then derived time-domain attributes from the RSS data of the tags. Subsequently, we applied a range of machine learning algorithms to differentiate between distinct cus-tomer behaviors concerning the tagged items. We conducted the experiments in a con-trolled laboratory setting, simulating a typical scenario within a retail store. 

We examined two kinds of tag reads, “no action” and “browsing” tags. The “no action” tag signifies instances where the customer shows no interest in the product, whereas the “browsing” tag indicates that the customer is actively exploring the product. This study employed a single RFID reader, the ALR-9900+, along with linear antennas ALR-9610-AL having a Gain of 5.90 dbi. Furthermore, all products were attached with UHF passive tags (Alien H3 model 9662). We improved additional ex-periment in our previous study, finally in total, 117 distinct data readings were gathered, with 70 readings categorized as “no action” and 47 readings as “browsing”.
